# Integrating Java with No Code

It's very simple to call No Code from Java. This repository contains the following:

- All the libraries needed to access No Code from Java
- A sample Java app that demonstrates how these libraries are used

## Getting started

1. Clone the No Code repository, included as a submodule here for your convenience.
1. Create or open a Java project in the IDE of your choice.
1. In your project, mount all JAR files in this repository's `bindings` directory. For example, if you're using Maven, simply insert the following lines into your project's `pom.xml`:
    ```
    
    ```
1. Use No Code's rich functionality just like you would in all your native No Code apps! For example:
    ```
    
    ```
    Another example:
    ```
    
    ```
